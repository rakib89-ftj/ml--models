🚀 Project Highlight: E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard

I’m thrilled to share my latest data analytics project, where I developed an interactive E-Commerce Sales Dashboard to uncover valuable insights into revenue, profit, and customer trends. 📊

Using Python, Power BI, and data visualization techniques, I analyzed real-world e-commerce data to understand:
✅ Total Revenue: 5.87M
✅ Total Profit: 970K
✅ Return Rate: 5.52%
✅ Orders Processed: 34.5K

🔍 Key Insights from the Dashboard

Electronics and Home Supplies drive the highest profit margins.

The Southern region recorded the strongest revenue performance.

Fashion and Electronics categories saw the highest product returns.

Monthly sales peaked in April and December, showing strong seasonal demand.

This dashboard provides a complete view of business performance — helping decision-makers identify profitable categories, control return rates, and target high-growth regions.

💡 Takeaway: Turning raw sales data into actionable insights empowers better business strategy and profitability.
